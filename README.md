# Spend-and-Snap

What if you could get more by spending less? 

Snapchat Ads may be the ticket to gain a broader impression without overspending.

While the data provided by Snapchat shows viewers that more money tends to result in more Impressions of your ad, it's not a solid relationship. 

According to Snapchat's Delivery Metrics, Total Impressions are "the total number of times your Ad was served."

For the 2020 election, it's no surprise that many candidates are utilizing Snapchat for advertisements. In Snapchat's Fourth Quarter they announced that their Daily Active Users (DAU) had increased by 31 million for a total of 218 million DAUs.

According to Pew Research Center, 62% of Snapchat users in the US are in the age range of 18-29, meaning they are eligible to vote.

There was a positive relationship between spending and impressions always, but what was intriguing was the varience in Impressions for Ads that spent the same amount of money. 

This linear regression had an R^2 value of 0.6277, this is how often the data fits the regression line. Since there is such a large variance in Impressions for the same values of spending, it makes the R^2 value less.

Age was not a strong predictor of Impressions. However, those who determined an accurate age range of users who would see the ad had a higher number of Impressions. Perhaps devoting more time to curating an ad users will enjoy and encourage Snapchat to serve an ad more often.
